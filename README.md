## Prerequisites
You will need the following:
* [BigCommerce sandbox store](https://developer.bigcommerce.com/docs/ZG9jOjM4MzMyNTE-create-a-sandbox-store?source=subscription-foundation) (required to develop and test apps)
* a database (BigCommerce recommends MongoDB) 
* a shipping zone with a [Pickup in Store](https://support.bigcommerce.com/s/article/Free-Shipping?language=en_US#in-store) shipping method 
* a [Stripe POS terminal and card reader](https://stripe.com/terminal)
* Experience using [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)
* Node.js 14.x

## Key areas of codebase

- `/backend`
  - Where the auth and various API services live. These are used within the internal API endpoints to keep routes secure and reach out to external APIs.
- `/prisma`
  - Where the DB models and initial seed data live. Prisma uses this to generate DB clients for the app.
- `/shared`
  - Where the types are located.
- `/src/pages`
  - Where the sections of the app are managed.
  - Next.js docs: https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/pages
- `/src/pages/api`
  - Where the APIs for the app are managed.
  - Next.js docs: https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction
- `/src/providers`
  - Where the context providers used within pages and components live.
  - Most are built using the concept of an 'ActionBuilder' that manages execution, loading status, and data setting consistently.
    - `/{provider}/context.ts`: The types used throughout the provider.
    - `/{provider}/index.ts`: The actions available to the pages and components using the context providers.
    - `/{provider}/ methods.ts`: The functions used within the actions to fetch / modify data.
